# functional_swift

This Repo is created so I can get a better understanding of functional programming. Swifts has really good features that
allow functional programming. As I continue to learn and explore functional programming through Swift I will update the repo 
with examples i've gone through. 

My learning resource is this https://www.objc.io/books/functional-swift/
